% What data did you use in your project? How was this data created What preprocessing did you do (if any), and why?

The dataset used in this project (called CAVES) consists of about 10k labeled social media posts regarding vaccine concerns. The dataset was compiled by Poddar et al. with the accompanying paper "CAVES: A Dataset to facilitate Explainable Classification and Summarization of Concerns towards COVID Vaccines" \cite{poddar2022caves} and issued under the GNU General Public License.\footnote{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#license-text} As claimed by the authors, CAVES is the first large scale dataset containing anti-vaccine tweets, that is not only binary-labeled (Anti-, or Pro-vaccine), but multi-labeled with the specific vaccine concern.
