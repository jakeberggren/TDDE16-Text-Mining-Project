Concluding the analysis, LLMs can be used for text classification and offer benefits for doctors and medical researchers picking out relevant medical abstracts. Furthermore, using one-shot or few-shot prompting with the LLM can enhance task performance, particularly for abstracts that may not have as clear linguistic features, even outperforming more traditional statistical methods. However, the current performance gap between the statistical approach and the LLM-based approach is not significant enough to justify the computational overhead and additional time required for using LLMs. This might change in the near future as LLMs are getting both better and computationally cheaper. In cases where there is a shortage of labeled data, LLMs can still be a viable option to consider due to their ability to perform the task with minimal examples.
